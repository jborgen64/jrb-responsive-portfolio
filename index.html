              <p class= "text-wrap"> I graduated from University of Missouri in 2014 with a degree
                        in Hospitality. I have since had a career managing various facets 
                        of the Kansas City Marriott Downtown, most recently in their Food
                        and Beverage division.</p>
                  
                        <p> I recently decided to look into a complete career change and
                          Computer Programming has always been of great interest to me.
                          The rest is history as I am currently working towards completing 
                          KU's Coding Bootcamp Program.</p>
                  
                          <p> Aside from my professional interests I enjoy all things cooking
                            and at one point was interested in becoming a chef and still have 
                            aspirations to own a restaurant. I also enjoy music and play several
                            string instruments. In my free time I lounge around with my fiance and 
                            boxer puppy child whenever I can.
                          </p>
